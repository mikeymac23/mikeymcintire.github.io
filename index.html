<h2>How I Became a Dawg</h2>
</body>
</head>
  <p>Ever since I was a little kid I wanted to go to The University of Georgia.
    Although it may have seemed it took a while for me to get here, I am here now.
    I went to a little school about 45 minutes away from Georgia's campus called Lincoln County High School.
    We are known for football and also one of Georgia's greats Garrison Hearsts. I
    forgot to mention my dream was, well still is to play for <abbr title="The University of Georgia">UGA</abbr>.
    I went to go play football at Kennesaw State for two years and now I am here at UGA to pursue my dreams.
  If I am unable to play for UGA, I would like to go another route and becaome a
  Grad Assistant for the coaching staff. Walking out of that tunnel on to field in Sanford
Stadium would just a dream come true.To see the whole stadium packed and cheering
just gives me goosebumps every time thinking about it. Finally if all else fails
though, I am still going to the best school in the world. No school compares to the
atmosphere that this little town of Athens has. Some call it the Classic City, some
call it the greatest college town in America. I'm just glad to call it home.</p>

  <h1>UGA Football</h1>
  <p> Here at UGA football means a lot to everyone and over the past couple of years
    we have been dealt with some very bad losses. Overall nothing can beat a Saturday
    in between the hedges in good ol' Athens, Georgia. We bleed red and black and
    no matter what we will be screaming "Go Dawgs".</p>

      <p>I would rank the loss against Alabama as the worst because that was basically
        the National Championship game. Whoever was going to win that, was going to win
        it all which Alabama did end up doing. I just want to see Georgia take home
        the title before I die, and I really thought that year was going to be
        the year they start a so called "Dynasty," and win a lot more following
        that year.Hopefully we will see a couple of them come back home to Athens
      in the next few years.</p>

        <h2>The Blackout</h2>
        <p>Georgia brought out the black jerseys for the first time in 2007 when
          we faced our rival Auburn. That game goes down as one of my favorites,
          because the atmosphere that night was surreal and everything was clicking
          for the Dawgs.We went on to win that night 45-20 By far one of my best
          memories as a football fan. I will get to create more memories on Saturday,
        April 22, 2017 at <time>2:00 p.m.</time> which will be Georgia's Spring game
      and my first game attending as a student here. </p>
